    ran with:  ionic serve --live-reload

    If you leave the homepage, and then go back to home page, google maps doesn't re-render the page for some reason
    Will have to figure that out for next milestone.  You have to reload the page, and sometimes restart the ionic server.

    The views look the best in a mobile layout.

    Tested on Android 6 and iOS 10.  
	
	Design needs to be updated. 
	
	UPDATE:
	Since Google Maps API has had some changes, we need to update the app. Until then it's broken.
